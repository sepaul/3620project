>  A diagram describing the network topology and nodes' distribution for the CloudLab profile. If there are nodes from different CloudLab sites, they must be clearly noted. 

* Descriptions of each Node
* File System - emulab zen (all) - c6320
* Parallel - dss7400
* large mem1 & 2 - c240g1
* compute1 - c220g1
* compute2 - m400
* compute3 - x86_64

#Palmetto Cluster Comparison 
> A section explaining why the network topology and computing structure of the CloudLab profile can be considered similar to the architecture of the selected XSEDE/Clemson resource. Citations describing the original architecture must be provided to justify these explanations. 


#Software Infastructure Deployment 
> A section describing in details how the script(s) work to support the deployment of software infrastructures. If you customize existing work (i.e., the OpenStack default profile for CloudLab), makes sure that the original work is properly cited and that you describe what changes have been made. 


#Results and Validation
>A section describing validation results.
